 *  @brief     Task I/O APIs
 *
 *  @addtogroup _task_ Task Management
 *             
 *  @details   This document discusses the APIs for, and high level design of, the runtime software 
 *             interfaces that enable the host CPU to send tasks to and receive tasks from virtual 
 *             pipelines.
 *             The CPU communicates with other engines in the system via tasks. The CPU sends and 
 *             receives tasks using very efficient, cacheable memory based producer-consumer style 
 *             DMA queues. These queues are called task queues and hardware support for task queues 
 *             is provided by the Nuevo CPU Adapter (NCA). Four types of task queues are supported: 
 *             task input queues, task output queues,   task completion queues,  and NCA task 
 *             receive buffer queues.     Note that input (Rx) and output (Tx) directions are from 
 *             the CPU’s perspective. That is, the CPU transmits tasks using task output queues and 
 *             receives tasks using task input queues.  The CPU uses task completion queues to 
 *             notify the NCA that processing is complete for a particular task.   Similarly,   the 
 *             CPU uses NCA task receive buffer queues to provide buffers to the NCA’s receive 
 *             buffer pool.
 *             The NCA is designed for multi-core CPUs and therefore provides redundant resources 
 *             to allow independent operation of each core (i.e. no shared resource contention 
 *             issues between cores). The first implementation of Nuevo is designed to support up 
 *             to 6 (4 internal + 2 external) CPUs. It provides 24 task input queues and 12 task 
 *             output,  completion,   and receive buffer queues. The motivation behind the 24 task 
 *             input queue number is to provide a minimum of 4 input queues per CPU core. This 
 *             allows each core to have high and low priority user mode and kernel mode task input 
 *             queues. The reason for 12 task output queues is to provide each CPU core with both a 
 *             user mode and kernel mode task output queue. Note that the queue usages mentioned 
 *             here are only for design sizing purposes. All NCA task queues are general purpose 
 *             and can be partitioned in any number of different ways, as configured by software.
 *             In addition to the 24 task input queues described above, the NCA provides a total of 
 *             8 logical task input queues where each logical queue can be mapped to as many as 8 
 *             real input queues. The NCA performs load balancing and ordering (if configured to do 
 *             so) for tasks sent to logical queues.
 *             As noted above the NCA design sizing accounts for the possibility of having both 
 *             “user mode” and “kernel mode” queues. This comes from the requirement to support a 
 *             very efficient (low CPU overhead) runtime environment for Linux user mode 
 *             applications. 
 *  @note      As noted above,  the NCA exposes numerous queues that are used to interact with the
 *             CPU in order to accomplish sending and receiving tasks.   Output queues can be used
 *             in either exclusive or shared mode. Exclusive mode 
 *             assumes that there will be no contention for the queue between multiple threads
 *             or processes.   In this mode,   no locking or other means of access synchronization
 *             are employed.   Exclusive mode therefore provides the highest level of performance
 *             since applications interact directly with the target NCA hardware queue in a lockless manner.
 *             Serialization using mutual exclusion primitives is required when output queues are shared,      
 *             so shared queues will not allow for maximum performance.

 * @brief   This API binds the specified receive handle to the specified NCA task input queue. Upon success a receive queue ID is 
 *          returned that can be used in later ncp_task_recv_queue_vp_bind calls to specify the various pipelines that the caller is 
 *          interested in receiving from.
 *          Only exclusive bindings are supported for NCA receive queues.
 *          An exclusive binding allows a single process to bind directly to an NCA task input queue. This type of binding 
 *          provides maximum efficiency in the case of a single process application model. In this case the ncp_task_recv function 
 *          services the NCA task input queue directly. 
 *          Multiple receive queue bindings can be created by calling this function multiple times with a unique ncaReceiveQueueId specified 
 *          in each call. When a receive handle contains multiple receive queue bindings the ncp_task_recv function services each queue 
 *          using a weighted round robin (WRR) scheduling arbitration policy.
 *          Receive queue bindings can be created and removed dynamically throughout the life of the system.

 * @brief   This API creates a binding between the specified receive queue and the specified virtual pipeline (VP). This is called a VP 
 *          level binding. Multiple VP level bindings can be created by calling this function multiple times with a unique {vpHdl, 
 *          engineSequenceId} pair specified in each call.
 *          Two types of VP level bindings are supported: shared and exclusive. An exclusive VP level binding allows a single process to 
 *          receive all tasks from the specified VP.
 *          A shared VP level binding allows multiple processes,  or threads,   to receive tasks from the same VP. Note that a shared VP 
 *          level binding can only be made (and only makes sense) when the associated NCA queue binding is shared. In this case a two-tuple 
 *          binding is created such that the calling process will only receive tasks that are from the specified VP and that are tagged with 
 *          the specified receive queue ID. Note that two ranges of receive queue IDs are supported: dynamic and fixed (see 
 *          ncp_recv_queue_create).
 *          Dynamic receive queue IDs are provided for the cases where either: the process does not use any shared VPs (tasks for these VPs 
 *          are not tagged with a receive queue ID), or where the shared VPs are only used for direct peer-to-peer communication. For 
 *          example, a single shared VP could be used for all inter-process communication (IPC). In this case each process creates a shared 
 *          receive queue binding and lets the ncp_task_recv_queue_bind call allocate a unique receive queue ID. Each process then creates a 
 *          shared binding to the IPC VP and advertises the unique {NCA queue ID, receive queue ID} pair that they are listening on. Now 
 *          to communicate with some process the sender creates a task, tags the task with the target processes advertised receive queue ID, 
 *          and sends the task to the processes advertised NCA queue. Note that in this case the only requirement for the per-process receive 
 *          queue ID is that it be unique for all IPC processes that are listening on the same NCA queue. 
 *          Fixed receive queue IDs are provided for the case where one or more shared VPs are used for communication with “replicated” 
 *          processes. For example, a shared VP could be used to send work to any one of several instances (one per CPU) of the same 
 *          process. Note that a logical NCA task input queue group must be established to allow the NCA to load balance and order (if 
 *          needed) tasks that are sent to the replicated process. In this case each replicated process creates a shared receive queue 
 *          binding to one of the NCA queues in the logical NCA queue group and instructs the ncp_task_recv_queue_bind API to use a fixed 
 *          (identical for all process instances) receive queue ID. Each replicated process then creates a shared binding to and listens on 
 *          the shared VP. Now to send work to one of the replicated processes the sender creates a task, tags the task with the well known 
 *          receive queue ID, and sends the task to the logical NCA queue ID. Note that in this case the NCA will choose the real NCA queue 
 *          ID (based on current load and ordering constraints) but the receive queue ID is constant and therefore all replicated processes 
 *          must be listening on the same receive queue ID.
 *          At this time the caller also specifies the task delivery mechanism for this VP level binding. If a task receive function is 
 *          specified (recvFunc != NULL) then tasks for this binding are dispatched to the specified function, within the context of the 
 *          ncp_task_recv caller. If a task receive function is not specified (recvFunc == NULL) then tasks for this binding are returned to 
 *          the ncp_task_recv caller.
 *          VP level bindings can be created and removed dynamically throughout the life of the system.

 * The data structures used/returned by these APIs match those used by NCA V1 hardware.
 * The legacy APIs can be used when running on a platform that uses NCA V2 hardware,   but there is a performance
 * penalty for doing so,   since the RTE software must convert between NCA V1 and NCA V2 data structures.
 * Futhermore,   an application that is designed to use the legacy APIs,   cannot take advantage of some of the
 * new APIs that were developed specifically for the NCA V2 hardware.

 * @brief   This API is called to receive a task. If the specified receive handle contains multiple receive queues then a weighted

 *          established at queue binding time. See ncp_task_recv_queue_vp_bind.
 *          Two task delivery models are supported: a return model and a dispatch model. In the return model the ncp_task_recv function 
 *          simply returns the next task and associated recvFuncArg to the caller.
 *          In the dispatch model the task is delivered directly to a pre-registered callback function (see ncp_task_recv_vp_bind). In this 
 *          case the ncp_task_recv function does not return with the task. Instead the ncp_task_recv function calls the user function that 
 *          is registered for the task's source VP. Upon completion of the client provided task receive function call,  the ncp_task_recv 
 *          API function will then return control to the caller with a status code of NCP_ST_TASK_DISPATCHED in order to allow the caller to 
 *          perform other work before processing the next task.
 *          Note that the task delivery model is configurable on a per-VP basis.
